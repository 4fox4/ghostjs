# Contributing to GhostJS

GhostJS currently has a few packages in the main repo and follows the mono-repo approach. The packages are:

* ghostjs-core - The main GhostJS package that users install with `npm i ghostjs`.
* ghostjs-examples - A folder which contains all of the tests that we run on continuous integration. Generally each ghostjs method has a related test in ghostjs-examples/. This is run on both PhantomJS and SlimerJS on every pull request.
